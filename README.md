# BeagleBoard Imager Rust

BeagleBoard Imaging Utility, a streamlined tool for creating, flashing, and managing OS images for BeagleBoard devices.

# Contributing

Please see [Contributing.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

# Packaging

Please see [Packaging.md](PACKAGING.md)

# Configuration

The boards and images are configured using a `config.json` file. This file will typically reside in a remote server. It is quite similar to the one used in `bb-imager` with slight modifications to allow use with non-linux targets along with more verfication.

See [config.json](config.json) for example.
